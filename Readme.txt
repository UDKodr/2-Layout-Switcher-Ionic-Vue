1-Layout-Switcher-Ionic-Vue

This Layout Switcher Allows you to make it possible for your users to choose the layout that they like best. Another benefit is if you want to test different layouts, or different versions, have users test and give feedback before making a final decision, etc. then you can add this and remove what you don't want to keep later!
