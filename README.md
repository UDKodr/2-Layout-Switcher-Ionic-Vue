<h3>1-Layout-Switcher-Ionic-Vue</h3>

This Layout Switcher Allows you to make it possible for your users to choose the layout that they like best. Another benefit is if you want to test different layouts, or different versions, have users test and give feedback before making a final decision, etc. then you can add this and remove what you don't want to keep later!

<h3>WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE</h3>
This template contains 3 different ways to use it.
1. A Settings page
2. A Settings Bottom Sheet
3. A Select Menu in the side menu

<h3>What you need to do</h3>
this repo contains the src folder from a side menu Ionic Vue Project
I have also included a[Readme 2 - What was Changed & Added](/Readme 2 - What was Changed & Added.txt) file explaining the changes to default files and what I've added to make it work.
You can drop the files in a new template and start using it, play around to figure out how it works. or you can tear it apart and copy-paste what you need to add to your own project.
Watch the video above for a full tutorial on what to use and how it works!
